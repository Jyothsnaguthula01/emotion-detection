# Emotion Detection using Machine Learning 🤖💬

This project uses a dataset of text-based sentences and classifies the **emotion** behind them using a Machine Learning model (Random Forest).

### 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Emotion classification (e.g., joy, sadness, fear, etc.)
- Trained ML model with prediction support
- Runs in Google Colab

### 🧠 Dataset
We used `emotion_dataset.csv`, a labeled dataset containing text and corresponding emotions.

### 🛠️ How to Run (on Colab)
1. Open the notebook:  
   [Click to open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jyothsnaguthula01/emotion-detection/blob/main/emotion_detector.ipynb)

2. Run all cells (Runtime → Run All)

3. Input a sentence and get the predicted emotion!

### 📝 Example
```text
Input: I’m scared and don’t know what to do.
Predicted Emotion: fear
